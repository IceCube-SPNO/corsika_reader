A simple example of how to use the C++ interface. To compile:

  cmake .
  make

Use it:
  ./corsika_example_1 <some_corsika_file>


This is a very simplified build. Currently I had to link the python libraries to this executable when compiling in my mac. If you get a 'Symbol not found: _PyBaseObject_Type' error, uncomment the commented line in CMakeLists.txt. This is 'not ideal' and will be fixed in the future.
